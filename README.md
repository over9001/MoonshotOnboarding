# Moonshot Collective Onboarding

Hello crypronauts!

I'm Ryan, playing the role of Moonshot Collective coordinator. I'm here to help you!

1: I'm looking forward to our weekly team calls Wednesdays at 12 Noon EST at meet.jit.si/moonshotcollective . 
If there's anything you'd like to put on the agenda, please let me know!

2: This is a TOTALLY OPTIONAL opportunity to meet with me and talk about who you are and where you want to go, and hopefully I'll be able to help you get there, either by pointing you to resources and opportunities or by connecting you to a moonshot team where you can use and grow your skills.

Please use this link to schedule a time to chat: https://calendly.com/ryanpetroff/discovery-call
I'm going to be adding more slots in the coming days, but if EST business hours are absolutely impossible for you, please let me know and we'll make time that works for you. 

3: I'm collecting ideas for projects for Moonshot Collective, including inward-facing tools that will make our lives easier as we build the future, as well as big public infrastructure and other useful programs. If you have ideas, please send them in!

That's all for today :)
See you soon,
Ryan Petroff
